 ### Background
 Over the last few decades predicting bankruptcy for companies has become an important area of study. The financial health of a company is crucial to many parties involved in the business domain such as investors, banks, the general public and especially shareholders. The focus has been on ascertaining the financial distress of a company through developing predictive models based on several econometric variables. Through this, accurate prediction of the financial performance of companies can be made and this information is used in the significant decisions that internal management must make as well as investors.
